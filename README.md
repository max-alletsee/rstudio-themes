# RStudio Theme Collection

This is a collection of custom RStudio themes that offer alternatives to the default built-in themes. If you would like to suggest a new theme, please create a pull request or open an issue.

If you would like to learn more about how to create custom themes for RStudio, please see the [RStudio theme creation website](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rstudio-theme-creation.html).

## How to install/use custom themes

RStudio supports custom themes in version 1.20 or higher. Themes can be installed via Tools - Global Options - Appearance - Add Theme. Once a theme is installed, the theme name will appear in the theme list and it can be activated by simply clicking on it.

*Note, July 8 2020: This list used to include a theme called Mojave Dark. I have decided to remove the link from the list after statements from the theme's author directly in the theme repository which I consider racist (calling supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement "cynical corporate cowards & desperate people pleasers"). If you think that the list above does not contain a dark theme that you'll like and really want to use the work of a person that makes such statements, please search for the theme yourself.*
